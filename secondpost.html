                        <p>There was an unprecedented increase in gun purchases beginning in January 2020. The main factor to this increase was the Covid-19 Pandemic, and others include the political and racial tension during the time.The increase in gun purchases ended toward the end of 2021 but appears to be surging again in the spring of 2022</p>
                        <p>The increase in gun purchasing was correlated with the increase in overall gun violence in the beginning of 2020. Then between 2020 and 2021, the firearm homicide rate increased by 15%, resulting in an average increase of 45% across the states from 2019 to the start of 2022</p>
                        <p>One unexpected trend that was observed during the initial year of the pandemic was a small dip in firearm suicide rates, which had been rising in the United States over the last 17 years. This was despite the pandemic and increase social isolation, going through a mental health decline and being concerned about illness</p>
